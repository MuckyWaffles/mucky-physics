# mucky-physics
An early demo of mass aggregate physics with Verlet integration, using Zig and Raylib.
I have a lot of fun projects and this one is closer to the bottom of my list.
I'm new-ish to Zig, and just wanted to make a quick project to test things out.
I do want to expand it's functionality to being a fully-fledged physics playground.
That's a fair distance into the future, though.

## Future plans:
- Allow our restraints to collide with world borders, maybe? The importance of this depends on where I ultimately onto to go with the project.
- Letting the user grab onto whatever particle or constraint they want.
- Being able to generate new particles and constraints on the fly.
- This is somewhat out there, but being able to create different levels,
where the geometry is made up of a series of line segments,
and being able to dynamically save, load, and create these levels.

And of course any interesting idea that happens to come into mind or be recommended to me (As periodic boundary conditions were)
