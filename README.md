# mucky-physics
An extremely early demo of mass aggregate physics with Verlet integration, using Zig and Raylib.
I have a lot of fun projects and this one is probably close to the bottom of my list.
I'm fairly new to Zig, and just wanted to make a quick project to test things out.
This isn't going to be a physics engine or anything, but I do want to expand it's functionality to being a fully-fledged physics playground.
That's a fair distance into the future, though.

## Future plans:
- Allow particles and restraints to collide with each other. This is a must-have,
but I'm still traumatized from my past attempts at implementing this...
- Letting the user grab onto whatever particle or constraint they want.
- Being able to generate new particles and constraints.
- This is somewhat out there, but being able to create different levels,
where the geometry is made up of a series of line segments,
and being able to dynamically save, load, and create these levels.

Having these things, except for maybe that last one, would put us in a really good place!
